<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: things</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Isaac hasn't come home in almost 24 hours, now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Elaborate.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: I believe he went around possessing someone</span><br />

<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: nah im just stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: nevermind</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: ...No. Are you on some sort of illicit substance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: i was drinking faygo earlier, so yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Okay so, TE, about the possessing thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Do we have any idea who, or why, or for how long this was planned?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: anyway, he possessed me a few weeks ago. I dont know what he's doing now</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: Res. No and no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: I don't know who she is. Just that she goes by Res.</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: And you have no idea what could A: be taking so long or B: the reason he possessed her in the first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: we dont poke into isaac's business</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: No to the first. Possibly because she hasn't been sleeping due to some nightmare or whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Well, fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. He's faffing about, worrying about some girl's petty problems with nightmares.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: what can i say, isaac is weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: I'd ask "would you mind if I popped in", but I suppose I already know the answer is no, and I'd just end up going over there anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: You can thank me for saving you from the formalities later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: thank</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: Well /I/ certainly wouldn't stop you</span><br />
<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ...okay... what exactly happened the past few days?</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: I really couldn't tell you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: I hope you don't expect me to read it back to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Starting from when, like Sunday?</span><br />

<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: idk, just, the "past few" days things have apparently hit the fan while I was doing something else each night...</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Oh, uh. Sawatari jobbed, we didn't get to see any of his new stuff. Gramps is absolutely LIVID about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: I went out to the grocery store the other day. Picked up some cereal for the kid and Gramps.</span><br />

<span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Pretty good stuff, though.</span><br />
