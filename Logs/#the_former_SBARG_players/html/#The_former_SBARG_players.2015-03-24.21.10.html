<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: Her concern's this gathering about any others, and out there... Probably nothing that could help her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: And you swear there's not a spctre among the lot who's a fitting match for me. I don't believe it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#261c2c">CTW: ...Things will probably get better if we manage to get somewhere not isolated...if we do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: You won't allow yourself a little more hope than that? When we're just a few steps away?</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well wilikers raz if worse comes to worse you can just spar with me</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: Will you turn it into a duel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: Because booster packs are one of the many things one misses out on in the endless void and I'm not in the known on at least new kinds of summon, maybe more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well i mean do you want me to</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: fuck it i'll just teach you the new shit if you want</span><br />
<span style="color:#261c2c">CTW: Well, we still have a few walls we have to go over...or bust through</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: If I want to fight you I'll fight you and if I want to duel you I'll duel you, I figure. But I will need a pile to deckbuild from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well i mean gramps has a huge collection i'm allowed to tap into</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: That works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: like the guy has like thirty Dantes i don't get it</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: how the fuck do you get that many</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: Dante?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: dante is a really meta card. it's like 80 bucks last i checked</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh welp it went down to 60</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: What's it do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: it's one of those xyz cards I was talkin' about a few weeks back</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: it's a rank 3. requires 2 level 3s, that is</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: if you remember Card Trooper, it's basically a better card trooper except you don't draw when it's destroyed</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: milling is really good this meta i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: I don't remember Card Trooper, sorry. Little further explanation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: okay so you pick a number from 1-3 with dante</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: mill that number</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so he's usually a 1000/2500 guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: but for every card you milled, that turn he gains 500 attack</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: of course, since you have to detach, as with most xyz monsters, he can only do this twice while he's on the field</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: in addition, this guy has the effect of, well, at the end of your battle phase if he attacked</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: he goes to defense position, so when he goes back to 1000, he's not going to be an easy shot at your life points</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: I was about to say that didn't sound too bad. Second effect sounds like a bitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well i mean it's only 2500</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: like that's alright but it's nothing to write home about</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: I can't tell if the game's gotten more broken or if you're being modest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: are you stuck back in the days where dark magician was good</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIT: Battle at Gospel</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: even during the synchro era, shit like DAD and goyo ran rampant. they can still kick this guy's shit in</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIT: I'll be waiting</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: Yeah I suppose.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and it's not like it's an effect that inherently gives you advantage</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: Like?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well y'know</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: advantage</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: card advantage, field advantage</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: plusses, minuses</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that kinda shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#261c2c">CTW: I am very lost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c92500">CRS: You never played Duel Monsters before?</span><br />

<span style="color:#261c2c">CTW: tried to get into the card game and I just..sucked</span><br />
<span style="color:#261c2c">CTW: so I gave up</span><br />
<span style="color:#5d8eb2">CBW: you go through a lot of sucking before you start getting good at anything, usually.</span><br />

<span style="color:#5d8eb2">CBW: sometimes you just have the talent for it and it all comes naturally to you, but it's not that common, really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#261c2c">CTW: I'm not really the type who can go through complex strategies and stuff like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#5d8eb2">CBW: it's not for everyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#261c2c">CTW: I did like the anime though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5d8eb2">CBW: i followed mostly up until 5D's series. i watched some of it but it didn't keep me entertained.</span><br />
