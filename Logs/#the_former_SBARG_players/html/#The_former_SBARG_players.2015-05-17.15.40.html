<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: yeah, im at the north pole and there are ruins</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Maybe if I dig into the snow a little.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: like, a house spire</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: covered in underlings</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: There aren't any underlings over here...</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh shit it's you</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: the android whose energy source i replaced with a beet while he was inactive</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well i suppose 'it' is a more apt pronoun</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: So is that why my battery says it is at 3e1% right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i didn't really</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: do that</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: No, that e is not a typo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i just wanted to see if you'd shut down to conserve power</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: And yes, it is really saying that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: which would be hilarious</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: but it ain't me this time</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: 3e1%</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: that reminds me of the score thing in minecraft for a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: and now its 9d3a%</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Yeah, my guess is... Magic.</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: fuckin' nerd</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: just call it the unknown again you uneducated peasant</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: *then you</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: for all I know it could actually be magic</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: of the kind fueled by mana</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I'd guess horrorterrors, but I doubt they would give a fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: if had, say, a blessed scroll of genocide from the game Nethack</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: (people still play that right)</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: if i declared 'android', would they be considered a race</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: or species</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: or whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: You would likely end an alien species coincidentally named Android</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I'm thinking it might be Ascii, so I'm trying to count it and read it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: w being 0, and q being 1.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: that seems to be it</span><br />

<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: not really sure what that means</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: it's a tumblr blog</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: A what</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: paste the url into a webbrowser</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Oh come on, I was halfway done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: eh, guess te found a faster way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Well this is confusing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: And no, I can't keep up with morse so easily.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: (at least ascii has the letters in order)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: It was simple binary</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: If I was a true AI instead of just a person in a shell I would have gotten it instantly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: well, it was slightly obfusicated</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: Ugh, morse code..</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: well, im going to go explore the snowy planet because im bored, good luck with the morse code and all</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: Well it starts with "This is a broadcast"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: Which is a bit redundant if you ask me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: I can't imagine the rest of the message is well-written</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: The message is exactly what the headline says</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: How useless</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: Although, there is a bit at the end where it stops forming words</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: - .... .. ... .. ... .- -... .-. --- .- -.. -.-. .- ... - --- -. - .... . -- --- .-. ... . -.-. --- -.. . -.-. .... . ... ... ..-. .-. . --.- ..- . -. -.-. -.-- .-.-.- .--. .- .-- -. - --- ...-- .-</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Used Audacity</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((tbh, didnt know audacity had that ability))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( It shows the audio, so I hand transcribed that ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( so I was sure I didn't miss anything  ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((THERES NOTHING THAT GOES .-.-.-))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((ah, nice technique. And yes, that is transmission one))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Anyway, since morse sucks, you can take over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING ME))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( Period. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((oh))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: So, we have:</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: "This is a broadcast on the morse code frequency. wnto3a"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: I assume the gibberish is a code for something</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: 3a is a spot on a chessboard</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: pawnto3a.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: Ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((oh i see whoever did the morse fucked it up))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((they did .-.-.- when they mean .--. .-))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( no, that was after the .-.-.- ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((the period is supposed to be p a))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((-sqUINTS-</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((oh))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((goddamn im bad at /reading/ morse))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((nope, the string of morse fl posted translates back to the original message</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: ((yeah ok im dumb dont mind me))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ef4f00">CTE: So does "pawn to 3a" have some deep meaning or is a chess game being slowly broadcasted in morse</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((I will say, the "this is a broadcast on the morse code chess frequency" part gets dropped in later transmissions as i realized it was just taking up space))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( I question why the white pawn didn't move two ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( From 2a to 4a ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((idk, i didnt think of it at the time))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: (( also, brb while i redo the later transmissions as i realized i fucked up))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: So, no /3a page.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I've tried all the pages I can think of, but nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: No hidden pages here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: and 3a isn't on the horrorterror blog either</span><br />
