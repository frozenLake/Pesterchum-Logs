<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: :3 this freaking code . mp1700 :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, why would seth want a path to his house when he's usually keeps to himself so often? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe its the start of a new era for him or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: or maybe hes just sick of getting lost in the woods, i dunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I really doubt he'd want there to be an easy way for others to find his house. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hey, i dunno his motivations</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like i say, maybe hes decided to be more social</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but then again, I'm just a weirdo investigator. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: youll have to ask him yourself i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hm, maybe I'll do that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: considering he has a handy path, I'm sure he won't mind me using it, right? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean if you want</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: could at least check around first</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a weird thing though, the path didn't quite connect to the town last time I checked earlier. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, why is it so quiet tonight? ➜</span><br />
