<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: It's hard to remember some stuff when you spend most of your time asleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: lolyes you did</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: so yeah. the red rift stuff was like.... months ago?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#80c0ff">CURRENT azureNova [CAN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: so right now, we have believed replacements of i&gt;a, k&gt;c, l&gt;d, n&gt;f, o&gt;g, and y&gt;q</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: so your trying to dechipher your old quirk</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ???</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: seems like it</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: this looks like a job for... the notepad.exe replace tool</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: except that could replace letters that are not modified, either, which appears to be the case.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: aaaaa </span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: then what </span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...have two lines, one replaced, one not, and do "random" combinations to see what make words that make sense?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((we seem to have reached "too much effort, fuck it" territory for this puzzle. Not saying it's bad, but more the least ammount of effort required tends to not happen with this group))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: okay....</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((*then the))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: let's see here</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: It seems to line up alphabetically, somewhat... so thats a possible theory for replacement.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: tyed putting them in, and all it changed was the... handle abbriviation</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: *tryed</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: notepad sucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...try replacing the other way, I was guessing that "original text &gt; changed text", not </span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: well, changed text to original, which wouldn't entirely make sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: hmmm.... found a new thing: g ==&gt; o?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...if feeding it into notepads replace function, just do a&gt;i, c&gt;k, d&gt;l, f&gt;n, g&gt;o, and q&gt;y.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I'm getting some stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: then we could maybe compare the lines...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS:  <span style="color:#add8e6">will anyone bother to make in attempt to listen?</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS:  <span style="color:#add8e6">I'm sorry. is that text I can't tell</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: *is that text black?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: it's micha colored</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I'm translating</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: oh okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: and using c=light blue</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS:  <span style="color:#add8e6">it eaoht? be a very dark purple</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: "it must be a very dark purple" maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS:  <span style="color:#add8e6">oh, come on!</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: no wait, "it might be a very dark purple" seems to be it</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS:  <span style="color:#add8e6">can't someone do the lighty thing ??? ??? some knowledge out on this?</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS:  <span style="color:#add8e6">god dammit make pay attention</span>???</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS:  <span style="color:#add8e6">will anyone bother to make an attempt to listen?</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: wait, I accidentally copypasted the same textblock twice</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I think that's all of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: eace could mean anything on this list: eace, eacm, eake, eakm, eice, eicm, eike, eikm, mace, macm, make, makm, mice, micm, mike, mikm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: and removing nonsence, we have mace, make, mice, and mike.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I'm guessing mice would probably be a good answer for someone clearly frustrated at the situation</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: "god dammit mike pay attention" and "god dammit mice pay attention" are the only grammatically correct solutions for eace</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: considering the timing and my own confusion, I believe it may be the former.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ...mike?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Well, I did mistake IT's chumhandle for someone else I know a few days back from my perspective, and if I was unable to communicate properly, I likely would have kept being confused.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: are you on the v2 side of the reset?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: hmm... I should mention this to Micha next time she's online. it might be important or something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Yes and no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: that helps...</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: I originated from it, but currently reside in a server in the ring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ah, your an AI</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: he mentioned that.... while you were disconnected I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: wait, do you even identify as a dud?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: *dude</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ah, okay then. just checking</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: should I page powerKitten and try to wake her up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Its more like I'm just someone who got all there limbs cut off and shoved into a sensory deprevation tank with computer access, in the metaphoical sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...I miss fingers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: o-o;;;;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#00aa00">CURRENT powerKitten [CPK]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: bluh, who woke me up</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: patrick did</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: RN you mentioned something about an ai?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: there's an AI on the memo, thought it might be cool for you guys to meet</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: Yeah, AN. Thought CaFAI might prove usefull</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: So, how are you azure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: I wasn't programmed in the exact sense, more like someone decided simulating a brain scan would be a good idea to make an AI. and then proceeded to do it again, /after memories merged after the first time/. And I don't see a second merge any time soon in the future.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: tl:dr, "I" am an idiot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: yep, you are a definintly a product of the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: doing really stupid shit with AIs was the thing for a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: Anyway, figure I might as well do an introduction</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...I don't know how my other self managed to go through with reloading himself from a backup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: um.... maybe he broke or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: I'm more of a hardware side, building and repairing robots and the like. While Katy(PK) is more of the software side, auctually doing the coding and debugging AI issues. We're the same guy just pre and post reset respectivly</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: altough Katy switched genders at some point apparently?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Ah yes, the session and the constant gender flipping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Why that is an alchemizable potion that can be cheap, no idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: As a premade potion it was pretty expensive</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Like what would its effect be on something that would be wildly different between genders like um... an angler fish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: it was just cheap to alchemtize the componets and handbrew it</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ah, the ingredient work around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: just like how jpeg shit is a decent fuel source for Mr Fusions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: lolwat</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: and I guess replicator raw material.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: v2 was weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: agreed.</span><br />

<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: yeah, good grief</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: seems like it was at least funner than our session though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Plus there was that dude that... huh, kinda having a hard time remembering his face. Its like a really blurry photograph.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: he was a sylph of doom tho</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: got eaten by glitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: a sylph of doom? eaten by glitches?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: i vagually remember him</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I think I remember reading about someone like that in shiny's journal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: uh, uh, it was... dammit it's on the tip of my tounge</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: let me check the word document</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: ((wow, i auctually completly forgot his chumhandle somehow))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: anyway, I could try and build you a robot body if you want AN</span><br />

<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: um... I have no idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: I'm sorry for snooping, but I'm just curious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: I'm just gonna bet its horrorterror influence and leave it at that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ((back. also it was squeamishVermin))</span><br />

<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: it's like, I can almost tell there's like.... something missing? just this really tired bluh type thing where it's like a window was left open or something and a cold breeze just whooshed past, slamming at least one door or something, sucessfully freaking someone out even though there's nobody else there.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT stealthyCalligrapher <span style="color:#688e2e">[CSC]</span>  wonders if there's a programming language with a boolean value that's true and false simultaniously... probably ~ath --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: it's pretty obvious micha has disassociative identity disorder</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: in layman's terms, multiple personalities</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: sorta sounds like it</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i theorize 'sol' has went dormant and is either fully or partially responsible for Gospel</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that specter that stole the rod, and the one who summoned that lens. golem.  thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: were probably both her</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: and usually Micha's like "but I can't summon my purse owner"</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: and then suddenly wham sunbeam stomps in</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: because it's like a personal thing i guess?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and it's not. HER thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: it's sol's thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: lemme see what else here</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: but like, Micha had the card in her hand</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: at least, I think she did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i have pondered the possibility that some of us may have developed these powers on our own with or without the contract</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: micha does indeed share a body with sol</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so sol could have still used it while indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: she was dormant in micha</span><br />
