<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#80c0ff">CURRENT azureNova [CAN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...I miss fingers.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: o-o;;;;</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: bluh, who woke me up</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: patrick did</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: RN you mentioned something about an ai?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: there's an AI on the memo, thought it might be cool for you guys to meet</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#00aa00">CURRENT rechargedNintendo [CRN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: Yeah, AN. Thought CaFAI might prove usefull</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: So, how are you azure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: I wasn't programmed in the exact sense, more like someone decided simulating a brain scan would be a good idea to make an AI. and then proceeded to do it again, /after memories merged after the first time/. And I don't see a second merge any time soon in the future.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: tl:dr, "I" am an idiot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: yep, you are a definintly a product of the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: doing really stupid shit with AIs was the thing for a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: Anyway, figure I might as well do an introduction</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...I don't know how my other self managed to go through with reloading himself from a backup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: um.... maybe he broke or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: I'm more of a hardware side, building and repairing robots and the like. While Katy(PK) is more of the software side, auctually doing the coding and debugging AI issues. We're the same guy just pre and post reset respectivly</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: altough Katy switched genders at some point apparently?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Ah yes, the session and the constant gender flipping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Why that is an alchemizable potion that can be cheap, no idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: As a premade potion it was pretty expensive</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Like what would its effect be on something that would be wildly different between genders like um... an angler fish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: it was just cheap to alchemtize the componets and handbrew it</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ah, the ingredient work around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: just like how jpeg shit is a decent fuel source for Mr Fusions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: lolwat</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: v2 was weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: and I guess replicator raw material.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: sounds like it</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#688e2e">CURRENT stealthyCalligrapher [CSC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: yeah, good grief</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: seems like it was at least funner than our session though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: Plus there was that dude that... huh, kinda having a hard time remembering his face. Its like a really blurry photograph.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: he was a sylph of doom tho</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: got eaten by glitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: a sylph of doom? eaten by glitches?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: i vagually remember him</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I think I remember reading about someone like that in shiny's journal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: uh, uh, it was... dammit it's on the tip of my tounge</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: let me check the word document</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: ((wow, i auctually completly forgot his chumhandle somehow))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: anyway, I could try and build you a robot body if you want AN</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: eh, I've gotten used to being a mind alone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: So uh, whats with all the static on the viewport?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: um... I have no idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: I'm sorry for snooping, but I'm just curious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: I'm just gonna bet its horrorterror influence and leave it at that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ((back. also it was squeamishVermin))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: squeamishVermin, that was his name</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: that'd be vneihfsiaklhsd's doing if I had to hazard a guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: sounds like a tool-oh hey Micha!</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">CAN: ...I'm... not entirely sure thats right. I mean, the second part, thats for sure to be right,  think, but the first part... IDK.</span><br />
